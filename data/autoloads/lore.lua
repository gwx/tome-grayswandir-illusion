#{bold}#Illusory Woods#{normal}#
New area near Zigur. Recommended level is 18.
Useful Stuff to have: High mental save, a mental status clear, some sort of tracking method.

#{bold}#Antiperception#{normal}#
Certain creatures have #{italic}#antiperception#{normal}#, which causes them to either be invisible or look like something else entirely. Antiperception power is generally equal to mindpower, but can be higher or lower based on other attributes. It is resisted with mind save. Taking damage from something with #{italic}#antiperception#{normal}# will give you a temporary 'memory' bonus, decreasing their effective antiperception power for you by (your rank * % life lost).

#{bold}#Illusion Damage Type#{normal}#
Like mind damage, but on a succesful save deals no damage instead of half.

	lore = [[To my friends and fellow protectors of nature:

The bearer of this letter is the young Roerl. You must begin training him in our ways immediately! Do not be fooled by his passive demeanour - for his age, he is exceedingly cunning and sly. In time he will surely be a powerful force against the dark arts. Already he has done nature a great service.

I am sure you are aware of my work, nipping at the heels and frustrating the efforts of those whose perversions of nature have made them too powerul to confront directly. But this child has accomplished more in a single night than I have in years! At the time, there was a very powerful alchemist who was subjecting the town to his deprevations. The clever rogue had somehow managed to sneak his way into the mage's inner sanctum, and was just leaving with much of the alchemist's ill-gotten gains when he ran into the alchemist himself. The alchemist, in a blind rage, unleashed every arcane contraption and foul invocation that he had upon the child. Only one blessed by nature could have escaped that fury with as few wounds as he did. Certainly, he came out better than the town did.

Lacking my keen eye, the (remaining) villagers did not see Roerl sneaking away from the carnage - they only saw, at last, the alchemist's insanity for what it truly was. True, half the village burned down, and at least as many villagers, but those who live now have a renewed understanding of just how terrible all magic really is.

It is my regret to report that the alchemist did manage to escape in the end - both the angry mob and my silent blade. For now, I must be content in the knowledge the alchemist's dark designs were at the very least disrupted. Tracking down Roerl, I explained this to him - how proud he must be, to fight so nobly against the mages, to have his face known to them as one of nature's protectors! Those very same mages who, through their wicked divinations could track down those who anger them no matter where they hide.

When I suggested that, through dedication to nature and training, he could learn from us how to guard himself against these magic users, he quite readily agreed.

Too often those of our more, shadowy, disposition find themselves tempted by the foul powers of magic. But this one is yet clean! I implore you, train him, hard and well. Make no allowances, for nature's need is great, and Reorl is quite #{italic}#dedicated#{normal}# to our cause.
